# description of program
This humorous webpage uses constroctor functions and prototypes that creates a game where two users can play Pig dice against each other.

Game Rules:
* Each player "rolls a die" by clicking the "roll it" button. 
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* A play that reaches 25 first wins.

# program setup instructions
* Clone this repository.
* Open index.html, CSS stylesheets, scripts.js.
* Then open the webpage via a browser of your choice.
